This vignette details the structure and construction of the `incidence_fit` and 
`incidence_fit_list` classes, which are produced by the `fit()` and 
`fit_optim_split()` functions, respectively. By the end of this tutorial, you
should be able to construct `incidence_fit` and `incidence_fit_list` objects for
use with your own models.
