Description: The incidence package takes lines lists and computes the
    number of incidents per interval (default = 1 day). In input
    should be a vector of dates, where each date indicates that a case
    was diagnosed with the disease in question. The output is a list
    with two members, the first date of the interval and the number of
    incidents in that interval.
