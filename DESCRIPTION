Description: The incidence package takes lines lists and computes the number of incidents per
    interval (default = 1 day). In accepts input dates in various formats, and returns objects of
    the class 'incidence'. These objects can be handled and visualised easily. In addition,
    log-linear models can be fitted to incidence objects using 'fit'.
